# Outline:
- An open-source tool created to make it easier for users to make command line wizards or surveys which are answer driven. The project has been published as a dart package and can be found [here](https://pub.dev/packages/cli_wizard_avs). Moreover, you can find an image conversion tool (PNG to JPEG and vice-versa) which has been built using this package here.
- Details about why I created this project and how it was constructed can be found below.

# Purpose:
- Before I began learning Flutter properly, properly here is a slightly tricky word and I mean it to be learnt how to methodically craft Flutter apps bearing in mind proper state design and architectural principles, I wanted to learn Dart at a more foundational level. 
- Although I have some degree of experience with Java, I don't have any experience using the core concepts of Object Oriented Programming in any language except Python, and Python is such that a number of the core features of OOP are absent. Therefore, I wanted to solidify my understanding of Dart, not only to be able to learn Flutter but also better understand some foundational programming concepts.
- I completed this project as part of a Udemy course on [Flutter and Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/dart-and-flutter-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/lecture/10645864?components=buy_button%2Cdiscount_expiration%2Cgift_this_course%2Cpurchase%2Cdeal_badge%2Credeem_coupon#overview), which I am finding an excellent resource in gaining an intermediate ability in Dart and the Flutter framework. 
- This build seemed rather simple on the surface, but having to understand how to create the tool within an OOP framework, learning about the basic file structure of a library and writing clean, reusable code made it so that the build was very engaging and its ease of use was paramount as I used it to create a file conversion tool as well.
