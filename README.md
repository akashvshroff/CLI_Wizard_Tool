# Outline:
- An open-source tool created to make it easier for users to make command line wizards or surveys which are answer driven. The project has been published as a dart package and can be found [here](https://pub.dev/packages/cli_wizard_avs). Moreover, you can find an image conversion tool (PNG to JPEG and vice-versa) which has been built using this package here.
- Details about why I created this project and how it was constructed can be found below.
